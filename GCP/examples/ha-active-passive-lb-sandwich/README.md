# HA Active-Passive

This template deploys 2 Fortigate instances in an Active-Passive HA cluster between two load balancers ("load balancer sandwich" pattern). LB Sandwich design enables use of multiple public IPs and provides faster, configurable failover times. HA multi-zone deployments provide 99.99% Compute Engine SLA.
